Description:
Follow the instructions step by step from part 1 to part 4.
Part 5, just follow the equation that provides in the instruction. 
Add-rat: takes two parameters:rat1 rat2. Then the answer of numerator is combination of  the numerator of rat1 times denominator of rat2+ the numerator of rat2 times denominator of rat1. Then the answer of denominator is just denominator of rat1 times denominator of rat2.
Min-rat:same thing, change the sign to the minus in the numerator
Multi-rat: the numerator of answer: numerator of rat1 times numerator rat2;
	   the denominator of answer: denominator of rat1 times denominator of rat2
Division: similar to the multi-rat
