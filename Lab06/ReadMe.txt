Description:
MyNode class is from previous lab.
Stack is defined in the lab description.
In MyNode, first implements Stack.
A constructor is used for setting the top node to null and size to 0.
isEmpty return whether size is 0.(I added the size by myself, itâ€™s not required, but useful for keep track of size of stack.
push() method creates a temp node to hold data.Since it is inserted in front. Temp.next points to top; the make the temp to the new top. Size increases.
pop(): checking whether the stack is empty first. Then create an instance to hold the top.data. The make top point to the top.next. Size decreases.
peek():same thing but do not delete.
