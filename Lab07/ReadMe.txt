Description:
MyDoubleNode class is from previous lab.
Queue is defined in the lab description.
In MyQueue, first implements Queue.
A constructor is same in lab03.
isEmpty return whether size is 0.(I added the size by myself, itâ€™s not required, but useful for keep track of size of queue.)
enqueue() method creates a temp node to hold data.Since it is inserted in the end. Temp.next points to tail;temp.prev points to tail.prev. Then make the temp.next.prev point back to temp and temp.prev.next point back to the temp. Size increases.
dequeue(): checking whether the stack is empty first. Then create an instance to hold the top.data. The make head point to the head.next. Size decreases.
peek():same thing but do not delete.

//in the comments, I used single node to create MyQueue which works just fine.
This can save the memory.
