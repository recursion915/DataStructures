Description: First 5 sessions are very straightforward. Session 1, I used Objects for 
printmethod(Obejct). Session 2 is just using different parameters for printmethod(over-
loading). Session 3-5 is to use generics by finding a max of different types of objects.
I have two classes of session6. One is for the test main method and findMax method.
The findMax method has function object, which includes in CharacterCompare class.
In CharacterCompare class, I defined my own way to compare the character. That is, 
ignoring the case.
